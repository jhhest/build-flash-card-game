# Project day - Flash card game.

Today you'll work on a fully functional web-app, using all the knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the DOM you've acquired so far.

## üéØ Learning Goals

- You are able to apply everything you learned this week without being told explicitly how to do it.
- You are able to build an interactive web app given a set of user stories.
- You are able to discuss the data flow in an app.
- You are able to collaborate with other developers to build a web app.

# This is a challenge for those who have finished

You should do this project when you've finished making the museum app. If your museum app is not finished yet, finish it first.

If you spend today finishing the museum app and and revising what you've learned this week, that's also fine.

## Build a flashcard webapp

The project is to build a client-side application that allows users to create flash cards.

This project is _supposed_ to be a stretch! It should take you well out of your comfort zone. For people/teams with more experience: try to build all of the optional features.

## Warmup exercise:

1.  Make a html file
2.  Make a h1 element
3.  Add an onclick event listener to it
4.  Add an event handler that console.logs ‚Äúhello world‚Äù
5.  Change the event handler so that it will make the h1 element change colour

Bonus: Make your event handler console.log the event object.

## See how far you get with these stories:

Remember that a software project is never done and there will always be new features to build when the time is up. If you don‚Äôt get to the end of this list that is fine - as long as it was a good learning experience. Focus on your process and way of working! Good luck!

## Flash Card app user stories

- As a student I want to see a random question so I can test myself
- As a student I want to access the flashcard app from the internet (Deploy your page to netlify) so I can test myself anywhere I am
- As a student I want to see the answer to the question so I can see if I was right
- As a student I want to get a new questions without having to reload the page so I‚Äôm not dependent on continuous internet connection
- As a student I want to add my own flashcards with a question and an answer so I can test myself with questions that I personally struggle with
- As a student I want to be able to have different categories of flashcards, so I can study different subjects.
- As a student I want to be able to delete flashcards so I can keep testing myself with relevant questions
- As a student I want my new flashcards that I made to be stored when I leave the page so I can shut down my browser (hint: you might want to use localstorage since we haven‚Äôt made apis yet, if you want to use an api checkout jsonbin)

If you get this far - expand with exciting features yourself!
